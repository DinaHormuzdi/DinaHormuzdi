# Hi! I'm Dina 😄
<p align="center">─────────────────────────♡─────────────────────────</p>

I love being at the intersection of technology, business, and design. Right now, I’m in the world of AI at Artificial Analysis, where I help evaluate and benchmark media generation models.

Before Artificial Analysis, I was a Product Manager at Microsoft AI working on Product Led Growth for Microsoft Copilot. I helped ship high impact features like file and image uploads and image generation without forced login, which increased weekly active users by 1.1M. 

Outside of work (and beyond being a bot learning to code 🤖), I’m usually doing one of these:<br>
🧘‍♀️ yoga / pilates<br>
☕️ making the perfect latte<br>
🏀 basketball<br>
🏐 volleyball<br>
📸 photography<br>
