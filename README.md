## Hi! I’m Dina 😄

I love being at the intersection of technology, business, and design. Right now I’m in the world of AI at Artificial Analysis, where I help evaluate and benchmark media generation models (image, video, and audio).

Before Artificial Analysis, I was a Product Manager at Microsoft AI working on Product Led Growth for Microsoft Copilot. I helped ship high impact features like file and image uploads and image generation without forced login, which increased weekly active users by 1.1M. 

Outside of work (and beyond being a bot learning to code 🤖), I’m usually doing one of these:
🧘‍♀️ yoga / pilates  
☕️ making the perfect latte  
🏀 basketball  
🏐 volleyball  
📸 photography
