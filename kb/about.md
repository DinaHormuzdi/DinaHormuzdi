## About Me

Hi, I’m Dina 👋  

I’m a product-minded builder with experience across product management, product strategy, and technical execution. I’ve worked across big tech and startup environments, and I love building tools that make complex systems feel simple and approachable.

This project is an LLM-powered experience where you can ask questions about my background, my work, and the types of projects I’ve built — almost like an interactive “living resume,” but way more useful. Instead of scrolling through a static page, you can just ask what you want to know and get a clear answer.

### What you can ask me
You can ask questions like:
- “What products have you worked on?”
- “What’s your experience with AI and model evaluation?”
- “How do you approach product thinking and prioritization?”
- “What’s a project you’re proud of and why?”
- “How do you work with engineers and move fast?”
- “What kind of roles am I interested in?”

### Why I built this
I learn by building, and I wanted to create something that’s both personal and practical:
- a real product experience powered by an LLM  
- a way to tell my story in a more interactive format  
- and a space to practice end-to-end product + engineering execution  

This repo is a work in progress and will keep evolving as I improve the quality of responses, add more structured context, and tighten the overall experience.

Thanks for checking it out — and feel free to ask anything 🙂
