## Quick Summary

Hi, I’m Dina 👋  
I’m a product-minded builder with experience across product management, product strategy, business operations, and technical execution. I’ve worked in both big tech and startup environments, and I enjoy building products that combine strong user experience with scalable systems behind the scenes.

I’m especially interested in:
- AI product development
- Model benchmarking + evaluation workflows
- Building tools that make complex systems feel easy to use
- Shipping quickly, iterating often, and improving through real feedback

## Core Strengths

### Product + Strategy
- Product thinking (what to build, why, for who)
- Defining MVP scope + iterating toward quality
- Writing clear specs / PRDs
- Prioritization and tradeoffs
- Cross-functional alignment (engineering, design, research, ops)

### Execution + Building
- Shipping end-to-end features
- Debugging + improving workflows
- Turning vague problems into clear, buildable plans
- Strong attention to detail (especially UX + edge cases)

### AI / Technical Interests
- AI product evaluation (quality, consistency, reliability)
- Multi-model generation + output comparisons
- Understanding tradeoffs like latency, cost, and model performance
- Prompt design + test case creation for image/video generation

- I work best with teams that value quick communication and iteration
- I like writing things down clearly (docs, checklists, PRDs)
- I’m strong at connecting product goals to execution details

### What I optimize for
- A clean user experience
- Strong product fundamentals (clarity + usefulness)
- Real outcomes and progress over perfection
- Processes that scale as the product grows

---

## Technical Skills (Current + Growing)

### Comfortable with
- Product documentation and planning
